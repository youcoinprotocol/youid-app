At the heart of YOU Protocol lies the power of Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) combined with the potential of decentralized data collection. We firmly believe in the pivotal role of individual data ownership, viewing it as the cornerstone of tomorrow's internet. Our mission? To foster an online ecosystem that places humanity at its core, all while anchored in a global identity and reputation mechanism.

  

Enter **YOUID**.

  

Upon joining the YOU Protocol, every user is endowed with a YOUID. This isn't just an identifier; it's a passport to a decentralized world. YOUID seamlessly meshes with prevailing identity systems, offering users a unified, decentralized account.

  

But what truly distinguishes YOUID? It's the innovative use of ZKP, ensuring user anonymity even as it provides a platform to proudly display one's reputation. This unique blend offers users a consolidated view of their digital reputation and credentials. They can selectively generate proofs for their credentials and present them to verifiers, ensuring they control which aspects of their profile are shared. And since all this data finds its home on the blockchain, decentralization isn't just an ideal; it's a reality.

  

For developers, YOUID presents a tantalizing frontier teeming with opportunities. Engage with the system, harness its potential, and be a part of the next revolution in digital identity and reputation.

  

## **Features**

  

1.  **Unified Identity Creation**: Establish an account with YOUID and consolidate your online presence.

2.  **Reputation Management**: Link with reputation providers, get the credentials and reputation insights added to on-chain groups, ensuring transparency and trust.

3.  **View Credentials**: Log into YOUID and see a comprehensive view of your online reputation and credentials.

  

## **For Developers**

  

1.  **Be Decentralized Provider**: Create applications that will feed credentials and reputation insights to the Protocol, forming on-chain groups. Add members to the groups.

2.  **Be the Consumer**: Create applications that can validate proofs submitted by users, ensuring a trustless verification process.

3.  **Enhance the ZKP Mechanism**: While YOUID offers a foundational Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) mechanism, we invite developers to build atop it, exploring enhancements and more efficient ZKP techniques.

  

## **Getting Started**

  

### Decentralized Provider

  

Apply to be a provider [here](https://w9n0ssyctbx.typeform.com/to/J2RQTR2V). Read [provider.md](https://github.com/youcoinprotocol/provider-devrep/blob/main/usage.md) for instructions on how to interact with the Protocol.

  

### Consumer

  

Integrate with the Protocol to learn how to consume the data. Verify proofs online or offline. Read [consumer.md](consumer.md).

  

### Contribute

  

Being open-source, we thrive on community contributions. Feel free to fork, modify, and create pull requests. We have a set of guidelines to help you contribute effectively.

  

1. Before diving in, familiarize yourself with the project's documentation, especially the README and WHITEPAPER. These documents often contain important information about the project and how to contribute.

2. "Good First Issues" usually are simplier issues and hence are great starting points for newcomers.

3. Always be respectful, patient, and inclusive.

4. Instead of directly editing the main project, create a fork of the repository. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original project.

5. Regularly sync your fork with the main repository to ensure you're working with the latest version of the code.

6. For each new feature or fix, create a separate branch in your fork. This keeps your changes organized and makes the pull request process smoother.

7. Stick to the project's coding standards and style guidelines, be it indentation, variable naming, or commenting.

8. Your commit messages should clearly describe the changes made. This helps maintainers understand your contributions.

9. Before submitting your changes, test them thoroughly to ensure they work as expected and don't introduce new bugs.

10. If the project has automated tests, ensure your changes pass them. If your contribution adds new features, consider adding tests for them.

11. If your changes warrant it, update the project's documentation. This can include inline comments, README updates, or more extensive documentation changes.

12. Once you're satisfied with your changes, submit a pull request (PR) to the main repository. Ensure your PR has a descriptive title and, if necessary, elaborate on your changes in the PR description.

13. Maintainers or other contributors might provide feedback on your PR. Engage in the discussion, be open to feedback, and make any requested changes.

14. Even after your PR is merged, stay involved in the project. Respond to issues, review other PRs, or contribute further as you become more familiar with the project.

15. Before contributing, understand the project's license. By contributing, you usually agree to release your contributions under the same license.
